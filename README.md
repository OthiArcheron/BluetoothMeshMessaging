# BluetoothMeshMessaging

This project is the start of something that I think could be innovative.

It could improve lives.

It could save lives.

At first, it will take time for me to create the basis of this project, but it will work. 

This will not be like other bluetooth messaging apps. That is because it will connect every single device to eachother. 

One to another. Each device will not only be the start and finish point, but the carrier of the baton, the message. 

When there is no internet, this will work.

When there is no cellular connection, this will work. 

When there is an emergency. Live on stake. This will work.



On a side note:
I will plan to have Alpha1 finished by mid-August, Alpha2 finished by about October, and Beta1 released to one small city in New Zealand by the end of the year. 

Beta2 should spread that out to the entirity of New Zealand. Beta 3 to Asia-Pacific. Then the full release will happen, to the entire world. 

This progressive roll out will help me in the earlier stages with debugging and fixing the software where needed. 

As I release each version of this project, I will update this document with anything important. 

Thank you,

Lachlan Greenhalgh.
